###  How to Start a Career into Cyber Security?
Cybersecurity has become an increasingly important field in today's digital age. With the rise of cyber threats and data breaches, organisations and individuals are looking for ways to protect their sensitive information from malicious actors. If you're interested in starting a career in cybersecurity, there are a few steps you can take to get started.

 **Step 1: Learn the Basics and Domains of Cyber Security**

Before you can dive into the world of cybersecurity, it's important to have a solid understanding of the basics. This includes understanding how computer systems work, the different types of threats that exist, and the techniques used to mitigate those threats.

There are many resources available online to help you learn the basics of cybersecurity. Websites like Youtube Channels [Cyber Mentor, Infosec4TC, TheHatedOne, NetworkChuck, Null Byte, John Hammond, Hak5, IppSec, LiveOverflow, GynvaelEN, etc], Coursera, Udemy, Cybrary and edX offer free and paid courses on various cybersecurity topics. Additionally, there are a number of books and online communities dedicated to cybersecurity that you can use to further your knowledge.

Cybersecurity is a complex and rapidly evolving field that covers a wide range of domains. Some of the main domains of cybersecurity include:

 - **Network Security:** This domain focuses on securing the networks that connect devices and systems, including wired and wireless networks, routers, switches, and firewalls.
 - **Application Security:** This domain is concerned with securing software applications and their associated data, including web applications, mobile apps, and desktop applications.
 - **Information Security:** This domain involves protecting sensitive information from unauthorised access, modification, or destruction. This includes data encryption, access controls, and data backup and recovery.
 - **Operational Security:** -   This domain covers the processes and procedures used to protect systems and data from internal and external threats, including physical security measures such as access controls, surveillance, and alarms.
 - **Disaster Recovery/Business Continuity Planning:** This domain involves preparing for and responding to disasters or disruptions that could impact an organisations operations or IT infrastructure.
 - **Identity and Access Management:** This domain is concerned with managing user identities and their access to systems and data, including authentication and authorisation processes.
 - **Cloud Security:** This domain involves securing cloud-based systems and data, including Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offerings.
 - **IoT Security:** This domain covers the security of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, including smart home devices, wearable technology, and industrial IoT (IIoT) systems.
 - **Social Engineering and Phishing:** This domain covers the psychological manipulation of individuals to gain access to sensitive information or systems, including phishing attacks and social engineering scams.

These domains are interdependent and require a holistic approach to cybersecurity to ensure the best possible protection against cyber threats.

**Step 2: Get Certified!**

Once you have a basic understanding of cybersecurity, it's time to get certified. There are a number of certifications available in the cybersecurity field, each with its own set of requirements and benefits. Some of the most popular certifications include:

 -  [CompTIA Security+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security)
-   [CompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst (CySA+)](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/cybersecurity-analyst)
-   [Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)](https://www.eccouncil.org/train-certify/certified-ethical-hacker-ceh/)
-   eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester (eJPT)
-   [eLearnSecurity Web application Penetration Tester (eWPT)](https://elearnsecurity.com/product/ewpt-certification/)
-   [eLearnSecurity Mobile Application Penetration Tester (eMAPT)](https://elearnsecurity.com/product/emapt-certification/)

Earning a certification can help demonstrate to potential employers that you have the skills and knowledge necessary to work in cybersecurity.

**Step 3: Gain Practical Experience**
While certifications are important, they aren't enough on their own to secure a job in cybersecurity. To stand out from other candidates, it's important to gain practical experience in the field. This can include participating in cybersecurity competitions, contributing to open-source projects, or completing internships.

There are a number of resources to learn, such as the Hackthebox (HTB), Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA), Damn Insecure and vulnerable App for Android (DIVA), Portswigger Web Security Academy, etc. Participating in these competitions can help you gain practical experience and demonstrate your skills to potential employers.

Additionally, contributing to open-source projects can help you build your portfolio (Github) and demonstrate your knowledge by writing blogs of cybersecurity tools and techniques.

**Step 4: Network**
Networking is an important part of any career, and cybersecurity is no exception. Building connections with other professionals in the field can help you learn about job opportunities, gain mentorship, and stay up-to-date on the latest trends and techniques in cybersecurity.

One way to network in the cybersecurity field is to attend industry conferences, events and make connections on LinkedIn. These events offer opportunities to meet with other professionals and learn about the latest technologies and techniques in the field.
